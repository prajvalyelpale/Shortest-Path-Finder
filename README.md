Dijkstra's Shortest Path Visualizer
This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a user-defined graph. It provides an interactive interface for users to:

Create nodes and connect them with edges
Specify a source node
Visualize the shortest path highlighted on the graph
This is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Running the Project
Clone this repository.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Interact with the interface to create nodes, edges, and find the shortest path.
Dependencies:

No external dependencies are required.
